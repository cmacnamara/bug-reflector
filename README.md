Bug Reflector is a blog-like app designed to give developers a space to log and reflect upon bugs that they encounter. It also allows users to comment on one another's posts so that users can build a supportive, reflective community. I believe deeply in the power of self-reflection. As a developer, carefully articulating one's bugs and their solution is an invaluable practice that can dramatically boost one's coding proficiency. This practice also helps developers become better mentors and fosters clear and effective communication between developers.

The app also allows users to view other users' profiles which contain a list of their posts. Users can also search all posts for specific keywords and phrases.
